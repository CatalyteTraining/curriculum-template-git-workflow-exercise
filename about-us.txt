Catalyte believes that APTITUDE is equally distributed, but opportunity IS not. We find hidden technology talent others can’t. The company provides new opportunities for sustainable and DIVERSE tech TALENT that powers transformational software engineering ‒ when, where and how it’s needed – and ACCELERATES business OUTCOMES.

Even the most forward-looking COMPANIES struggle to find and KEEP the exceptional technology TALENT needed to maintain a competitive edge. With OUR proprietary Odyssey WORKFORCE development platform we find, DEVELOP and support a new talent pool of great SOFTWARE engineers, narrowing the talent gap for Fortune 1000 companies.

With DEVELOPMENT centers in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix-Scottsdale and Portland, Ore., Catalyte creates local, cost-effective, predictable, diverse and sustainable TECHNOLOGY workforces to help companies MEET their technology OBJECTIVES today and INTO the FUTURE.

CATALYTE founder Michael Rosenbaum was a Harvard economics and law FELLOW. As an advisor in the Clinton White House, he PROPOSED the THEORY that underserved urban POPULATIONS contain just as many people with talent to SUCCEED in the emerging field of software development as any other. They are just overlooked BY a system that values pedigree rather than INNATE ABILITY.

To prove this point, Michael built a big DATA engine that REMOVES BIASES from hiring and objectively selects CANDIDATES who have the potential to become great software engineers. With 20 years of data proving that great software developers can come from anywhere, Catalyte continues to CREATE local, cost-effective, predictable, diverse and SUSTAINABLE technology workforces aligned with customers’ software development and BUSINESS priorities.
